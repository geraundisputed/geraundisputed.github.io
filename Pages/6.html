        Its an eerie feling, it really is. <br>
        Looking back on a childhood memory and analyzing 
        the emotions that led your actions, as unaware of them as you were at that age. <br>
        Almost like dreams come with a sense of understanding that couldnt be had just 
        from context clues, it is engrained in the altered consciousness; <br> 
        Imagine reading a script before watching a movie that only has scenes for half of the story. <br> <br>

        In that sense, <br>
        childhood life hides prejudice and morality and cooks only in 
        the stove of discovery. <br> 
        Everything was new and with discovery, the awe of it 
        all leaves no space to judgement. <br>
        Judgement as the all dimensional scale that 
        weights our experiences. <br> <br>

        Nowadays everything is either a good outcome or a poor choice or a chance to 
        improve or good luck, thumbs up this or thumbs down that. <br>
        The standard is so low “meh” became some sort of divine belief only the enlightened thinkers strive for. <br> <br>

        “How was your day” and in silence i ramble through the parallax using my 
        evolutionary social skills to determine i cant remember when we started doing 
        this guilty/proud thing. <br> <br>

        Kids have discovery, we adults have car keys.

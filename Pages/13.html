        I stood there. <br>
    My unimportant office as the Guggenheim.<br>
    The geometric made sense as soon as my peripheral ears paid slight attention to the rain.
    The rhythm as aid.<br><br>

    I once heard a critique towards the modern abstracts. 
    In her defense, her heart gets in the way to her possible career as an art dealer. <br>
    “Art is time. Only patience can showcase love, since the artist is determined to love its piece”<br><br>

    For me the concept is so stimulating, when the material outcomes im already satisfied and look 
    at it as an uneventful but well received consequence. Even experiencing the material is a blurry 
    stare in which i wander off to the intellectual dimension.<br><br>

    Kandinsky on the other hand was probably just autistic and synesthetic.<br>
    But beatifying the internal necessity.
    Thats love as well.<br>
    Thats venerating the intention.
    To respect it and bring it to life so that its relieved
    of its torture.<br>
    Thats love as well.

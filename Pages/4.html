        Countless times ive heard grandpa say how bad we need to have some drinks together. <br>
        It goes all the way back to my age making the proposal sound ridiculous and a good 
        relief for a stale party. <br> <br> 

        With time what used to result in giggling now provokes a more complex and silent 
        reaction from my part and a ridiculous and good relief tell off from grandma, <br>
        “such influence you are” but i know what he meant. <br> <br>

        I too feel encapsulated by sharing my heart with someone i somewhat know about. <br>
        It always felt like a secrecy look we would share when everyone else in the 
        room was laughing too hard to keep their eyes open. <br> <br>

        Until i had her read me an entire 1950s sewing book and realized she gets drunk on dresses

            1. New phone in hand <br>
            2. Gets greeted in every language <br>
            3. Goes to the camera app <br>

            For a second i actually believed my life was going to depend on me understanding the structural 
            language of photography. I cant say i got any closer to.
            <br>
            What actually happened is i lost my eyes. Anytime my brain would register a thing it would violate 
            my eyes entirely and go straight to the steady hand-holding procedure.

            When people share their love for “the small things” what they actually mean is a need to belong 
            to a cultural group whose only rules of admission are some loosely picked set of aesthetics. 
            <br>
            I never paid attention to the damn small things, they were yelling so loud i could barely concentrate.
            <br>
            Nowadays cute memories packaged in 4:3. Back then, involuntarily invented narrative in the most 
            dormant places.

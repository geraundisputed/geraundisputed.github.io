        Never been the type to face the front door. <br>
        Its tough to admit if youve grown on the culture that promotes banging on multiple 
        until one eventually opens. <br> 
        This word eventually feels to me, like a trick. <br>
        As if math had emotion and the equation read 
        “the higher the number the higher the possibility of… well- just keep trying until eventually”. <br> <br>

        The eventually stops being a goal anymore, a fictional place you can get to 
        and becomes a fictional optics quota. <br>
        So that you appeal and therefore everyone can feel reassured. <br> <br>

        In privacy i face it though. <br>
        i cant tell if im rebelling against it being known 
        what my true intentions are, or if in sollitude, <br> 
        when the salesman has no customer 
        the need to sell is heightened. <br>
        Selling to yourself means youre aware of the tactics 
        and cant get fooled by the other party, only then, you face the front door without 
        having a real reason… until eventually

        The are you hungry yet was always half unexpected. <br>
        It seemed to know it was due on lunch time but was always asked at a different particular time. <br>
        Almost as if the person asking slowed it down. Ive always thought a battle was fought everyday 
        between worry and helplessness- it was what is considered a formality- since i never took it 
        too seriously. <br> <br>

        I imagine my relatives thought of me as a neo human capable of living by some sort 
        of super resource efficient tech, but not robotic enough to get rid of the question altogether. <br> <br>

        The are you hungry yet was so hard to ask it shapeshifted the faces of those who dared, <br>
        separating the eyes from the mouth, each going into a different emotional place. <br> <br>

        Truth is it was equally difficult to answer as well. <br>
        Sometimes my no, not yet was innocent and well intended, <br> 
        other times my mouth and eyes divorced each other. <br>
        Each going into a different level of starving. “No, not yet” and my eyes salivated traumatized.

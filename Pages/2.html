        A childhood signature sounds like such a contradiction. <br>
        I had a few of those training moments where i fabricated my identity. <br>
        Just like a time comes where you have to actively choose what your answer is going to be when
        asked of your favorite color. <br>
        I navigated through squiggly and straight, repetitive or concise, i did it for those 
        imaginary documents i would never sign. <br>
        Now that i have a signature nobody can tell me who i am, cause im sure my favorite 
        color is red and not all of the social connotation it includes, and that i am 12 and not a 
        kid anymore.

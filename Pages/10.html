        “And i turned out fine”.<br>
        Most often said when neglecting a child, this fallacy i dont care to analyze.<br>
        Im much more interested in this idea arranged in a hurry where, our mediocrity 
        seems to us as the utmost pure example of human condition, <br>and therefore give it 
        a stretched sense of value.<br><br>

        When asked if you would do anything differently in life theres this popular option 
        where the answer is no: all of my mistakes have made me. <br>The existential man is so 
        scared of losing this made up identity they wouldnt bargain with it, they wouldnt 
        even touch it even if it put them out of mediocrity.<br><br>

        To parent your child better. Not better in a way where you dramatically avoid those 
        things that make you not call your own parents sometimes.<br>
        Actually better.<br><br>

        Youve gotta accept you didnt turn out fine.<br>
        Because you dont exist. Be born everyday.

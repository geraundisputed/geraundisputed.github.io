        I guess being born in the digital era means when i was grounded as a kid that usually 
        didnt include my toys, <br> those semi-forgotten analog plastics and fabrics that defied 
        creativity and i would go to as a last resort. <br> <br>

        The digital era also got rid of toy turism and even early forms of trading. <br>
        There was some sort of parallelism that existed when i had playdates and would 
        see a friends setup in their own room. <br> As if the toy basket or chest or box or 
        predetermined corner would mutate across different dimensional childhoods, 
        all including their own type of action figure, vehicle and neglected baby toy.<br> <br>
        
        Looking at your left out baby toys as a toddler was some sort of feeling, 
        that barely resembles that of glancing at your toys when the ipad battery ran out.
